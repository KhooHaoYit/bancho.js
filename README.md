## Current release: v0.3.0

# Introduction

bancho.js is designed to be the best library when it comes to interacting with bancho in real-time. It connects over its IRC interface and enables you to do anything you can do over IRC - and much more to come!

It is designed to be reliable and easy to use. It has already been successfully used in several projects, most notably [OHC.gg](https://ohc.gg).

Its development is only at the early stages at the moment - it doesn't do more than a standard IRC library would. However, feel free to have a look at the [issues](https://git.cartooncraft.fr/ThePooN/bancho.js/issues) to get an idea of what's coming!

# Examples

To get an idea on how easy it is - check the examples in the [examples](examples/) folder!

# License

It is licensed as GPL 3.0. The entire license text is available in the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file, however I recommend you to take a look at this [short summary](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) to get a better idea!

# Documentation

# Support The Development

I'm just a 17 years old teenager, and you may know me better as an [osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/ThePooN) and [Twitch streamer](https://twitch.tv/ThePooN02). I'm also studying computer sciences at university in Reims.  
If this library helped you or anybody you know or just appreciate the free time I spend on this project, feel free to support me by [subscribing](https://twitch.tv/ThePooN02/subscribe) to my Twitch channel or [donating](https://streamlabs.com/ThePooN02)!  
Most of the time spent on this library will also be livestreamed on the same aforementioned Twitch channel.
