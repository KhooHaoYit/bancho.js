# Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute to the Bancho.js project! There are currently many tasks to be done still. Since the project is still relatively small and moving pretty fast without much defined base, I welcome you to contact me over [Discord](https://discord.gg/ThePooN) before contributing.

The public documentation is for the end-users; I recommend you to generate the private documentation for development purposes with `npm run doc:dev` to begin with.  
After that, feel free to look at the [issues](https://git.cartooncraft.fr/ThePooN/bancho.js/issues) and... do something!  
I'll also require you to pass the CI tests. The `irc` test requires you to set up the `IRC_USER` and `IRC_PASS` variables in your project CI / CD settings, although I will be lenient on MRs not affecting the actual code on this test.

Feel free to create issues as well, and MR your work once you're finished.

Thanks for contributing! ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™
